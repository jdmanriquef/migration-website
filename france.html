        <h2>how easy is to migrate to france</h2>
        <p>Migrating to France depends heavily on your circumstances and visa requirements, but it's not inherently easy. For short stays (under 90 days), EU citizens and some non-EU citizens may not need a visa, while others will need a short-stay Schengen visa. For longer stays or permanent residency, you'll likely need a long-stay visa and eventually a residence permit. </p>
