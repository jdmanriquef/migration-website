 <h2>How is migration in Russia</h2>
  <p>Migration to and from Russia is a complex issue with various factors influencing it. Russia is both a destination for many immigrants and a source of emigration for some of its citizens. The net migration rate is a net inflow of 1.7 migrants per 1,000 population, according to 2023 estimates.<p>

  <h2> Emigration</h2>
  <p>A significant number of Russians emigrate, with many choosing CIS countries or those near the CIS region as their destinations. The desire for better opportunities, a better quality of life, and concerns about the economic situation in Russia are common reasons for emigration. </p>
