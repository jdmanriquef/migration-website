<h2>how is migration in Peru?</h2>
<p>Peru's migration history is characterized by significant outmigration of Peruvians seeking better living conditions, but recent years have seen a surge in immigration, particularly from Venezuela. Historically, Peru was a sending country, but the influx of Venezuelans, combined with the potential for climate migration, has transformed it into a destination country.

<h2> How costly is life in Peru?</h2>
 <p>In general, Peru is slightly more expensive to live in than Colombia. While both countries offer relatively affordable living compared to North America or Europe, Peru's prices for certain items, like rent and groceries, may be slightly higher.  </p>
<h2> How easy is it to migrate to Peru?</h2>
<p>Permanent residency is not possible in Peru, aside from two options: either you have a job, or a Peruvian spouse. Otherwise you will either be obliged to take out a tourist visa for 90 or 183 days, or a work permit, or have lived and worked in Peru long enough to qualify for naturalization.</p>

<h2>Advantages</h2>

<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
<p>Migrating to Peru can present several disadvantages. These include safety concerns, language barriers, a potentially challenging bureaucracy, and the possibility of overcharging for goods and services due to foreigner status. Additionally, navigating the public transportation system can be difficult, and while some areas offer a high standard of living, others may be less desirable. .</p>
