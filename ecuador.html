        <h2>how is migration in ecuador</h2>
         <p>Ecuador is both a country of origin for emigrants and a destination for immigrants. Ecuadorian citizens emigrate primarily to Spain, the United States, and Italy. Immigration to Ecuador has increased, with many refugees and migrants arriving from Colombia, and since 2010, from Cuba and Haiti. A significant influx of Venezuelans fleeing their country's crisis has also impacted Ecuador's immigration landscape. </p>
