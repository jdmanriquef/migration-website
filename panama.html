<h2>how is migration in Panama</h2>
<p>Migration through Panama, particularly via the Darien Gap, is a significant issue, with increased traffic and challenges for both migrants and the country. Historically, Panama has been a transit country for migrants heading north, often with the US as their ultimate destination. However, a "reverse migration" phenomenon has emerged, with more migrants now moving south, many of whom are from Venezuela. </p>

<h2> how easy is to migrate to Panama</h2>
<p>Migrating to Panama can be relatively straightforward for those who qualify for specific residency visas, like the Friendly Nations Visa or the Pensionado Visa. However, the process can be lengthy and involves paperwork and legal procedures. Overall, it's easier to move to Panama if you have a strong financial situation or a job offer in the country. <p>
