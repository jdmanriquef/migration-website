<h2>how is migration in austria </h2>
 <p>In 2022, Austria welcomed 93,000 new immigrants on a long-term or permanent basis, a 22% increase from the previous year. These immigrants include those benefiting from free mobility, labor migrants, family members, and humanitarian migrants. Austria's migration system is geared towards skilled workers, with specific schemes like the Red-White-Red Card. However, there are challenges in attracting significant numbers of foreign workers due to complex procedures and language requirements. Family reunification and asylum-related migration are also significant contributors to Austria's migration profile. </p>

  <p>Migrating to Austria is easier for EU/EEA citizens and Swiss nationals, who can stay for up to 3 months without a visa and can reside longer if they meet certain requirements. Non-EU/EEA citizens, however, generally require a visa and residence permit to stay longer than six months, with the type of permit depending on their purpose of stay (work, study, etc.). </p>
