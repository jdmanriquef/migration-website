    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>As of November 2024, UK authorities have established that Colombians require a visa to enter the country. This immigration policy change affects all travelers.</p>
    <p>In England, you have to look for a stable job that pays you well in order to rent an apartment and with the money you can have the necessary goods, such as food or even the place where you live and sleep.</p>
    <p>In England you should also know that one pound sterling is equal to 5,319.87 Colombian pesos.</p>

    <h2>Advantages</h2>
    <p>You'll be able to practice your English daily. We know that when we work and/or study in a language other than our own, we learn intensively and almost without realizing it. Furthermore, you can find different dialects and accents throughout the country.</p>
